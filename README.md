# 🚀 Customer Churn AI WebApp

A full-stack **Machine Learning + Streamlit Web App** that predicts **Telecom Customer Churn** using logistic regression. Built end‑to‑end for real‑world execution — including training pipeline, model deployment, UI, and portfolio deliverables.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project analyzes telecom customer behavior and predicts **whether a customer is likely to churn** (leave the service). Companies use churn prediction to reduce customer loss and improve revenue.

This repository contains:

- ML training notebook (data cleaning, EDA, modeling)
- Saved ML model (`.pkl`)
- Professional Streamlit web app to make predictions
- Deployment‑ready project structure

## 🌐 Live Demo (Coming Soon)

🔗 Streamlit Cloud URL — to be added after deployment

---

## 🎯 Features

✔ Predict churn with probability score ✔ Interactive, modern Streamlit UI ✔ Logistic Regression baseline model ✔ Model persistence using Joblib ✔ Clean professional code for interviews & resume ✔ Ready for deployment

---

## 📊 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit‑Learn
- Joblib
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (EDA)
